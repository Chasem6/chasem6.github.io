Sir Isaac Newton was quoted as saying "If I have seen further it is because I have stood on the shoulders of giants".  In the computer science world, we can call one of these giants, design patterns.  Over the years, we have determined general solutions for an array of common problems.  These solutions are called design patters.  The idea of design patterns was first introduced in 1994 by a group now known as the gang of four.  In their book, "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software", they use c++ to explain the advantages and disadvantages of basic software design patterns.
