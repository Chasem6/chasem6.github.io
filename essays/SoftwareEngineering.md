 I learned that software engineering is dificult.  There are many moving parts that have to be accountable for.  You have to be constantly learning because things adapt and are updated so often.
 
 I had to learn how to use a new development environment.  I liked eslint once I figured out how to make it actually work.
 
 I learned about developing software with a group.  Communication becomes very important.  As a group we have to agree on naming conventions, or everyone will make their own names and there will be no uniformity in the code.  you also have to pay attention to the coding standards because it helps the organization and it helps the debugging.  It is also important to always stay up to date with the master branch and contribute to it as soon as you have an acceptable working branch.  
 
 I learned that I don't really like computers that much and coding isnt fun like it used to be.
