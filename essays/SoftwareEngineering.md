 I learned that software engineering is dificult.  There are many moving parts that have to be accounted for.  Every time you think you know something, you are reminded you know nothing... In software engineering, you need to be constantly learning.
 
  I learned the grind that software engineers have to endure.  I just have to take a moment to appreciate my own resilience as I closed out my software development course with the [black screen of death](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/250632230).  But that problem is just a representation of what software engineering is.  You run into problems, but you find a way to make it work.  Asking questions is huge in software engineering.  There is an impressively large community of people on the internet who are willing to help, so long as you can provide a smart question.
  
I had to learn how to use a new development environment, and I had to learn to get used to it quick.  Coding has really pushed my adaptability, and flexibility is rewarded.  I liked eslint once I figured out how to make it actually work. Coding is mentally taxing.  It requires perfect precision because one mistake means a broken code.  
 
 I learned about developing software with a group.  Communication becomes very important.  As a group we have to agree on naming conventions, or everyone will make their own names for variables, and there will be no uniformity in the code.  You also have to pay attention to the coding standards because it helps the organization and it helps the debugging.  It is also important to always stay up to date with the master branch and contribute to it as soon as you have an acceptable working branch.  
 
 I learned that I don't really like computers that much and coding isnt fun like it used to be.
