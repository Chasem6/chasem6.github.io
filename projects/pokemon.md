 POKEMON

This is a text game that I developed with another classmate for a final project.  It is based on the popular Pokemon game.  Random Pokemon appear to the user.  The user then has the option to catch the pokemon, or run.  Caught pokemon can later be displayed in a pokedex menu.

Workload ws shared between the two of us.  This project gave me a crash course into developing with github, as well as challenged me to strengthen my java coding skills.  I was able to learn a lot about object oriented programming.
