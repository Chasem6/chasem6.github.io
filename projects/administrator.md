SALESFORCE ADMINISTRATOR

This is a goal I am pursuing outside of school.  Being relatively new to the computer world, I am discovering the massive amount of opportunity out there, and am still in search of a passion in this field.  I had to say yes when I was presented this opportunity by local startup, Purple Mai’a.  I am currently about halfway through my training and really excited to be learning something new.
