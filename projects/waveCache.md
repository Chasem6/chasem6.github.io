WAVECACHE
As a final project to our software engineering class, I collaborated with a group to present wavecache, a surf focused website.  Our goal was to bring realtime data to our presentation of surfbreaks found around Oahu, with the goal of introducing new surfers to our waters.  Suggested breaks, a forum for each break, and a friends list where you could connect and meet the people you surfed with.  Unfortunately, it didn't reach full completion in the time we were given, but I am still happy with what we accomplished.  I was in charge of doing UI work for the forum and friends page.  After that was finished, I took a crack at making the forum a fully functional page with cards and a chat for every single break. This proved to be a challenge for me.
